Download the SDK from tapjoy, and replace this directory with it.  (Don't change this directory name though.. so TapjoyConnectVrtualGoodsSDK_iOS_v8.1.7 should be changed to TapjoyConnectVirtualGoodsSDK_iOS to match this dir name

Example of usage in RTAdTest

NOTE:  This is for V8.X of Tapjoy.  If you're trying to use the new version, V9, well, everything broke.  But you can actually use it, check the Proton wiki for info and put the files in shared\iOS\TapjoyPublisherLibrary instead.  (V9 has a dir by that name to copy in).
